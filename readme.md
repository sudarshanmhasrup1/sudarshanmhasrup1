### Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Hi! Thank you so much for checking out my GitHub profile. Let me introduce myself. I'm `Sudarshan Mhasrup`, and I like
to solve real-world and business problems. There are many ways to do it, but I choose the way of software development.
The reason? Well, I was always curious about how computers work and how I could build my own programs that run on Web,
Mobile, and Desktop. So, I decided to learn programming, which turned out to be the best thing I do every time. I like
to build stuff, not just code.

I started learning to build mobile apps using a no-code tool called `Sketchware`. Later, I learned `Java` and began
building fun projects using `Java` and `XML`. During the second year of my college, I found myself enjoying `Kotlin` and
its ecosystem. So, I decided to go for it because I fell in love with `Kotlin`. Nowadays, I'm totally into `Kotlin`. Its
multiplatform nature has enabled me to develop apps that run on mobile phones, desktop PCs, the web, and more.

I craft user interfaces using `Jetpack Compose` for `Android` and `Compose Multiplatform` for `Kotlin Multiplatform`
projects. I love the ecosystem, which helps me deliver solutions faster and more efficiently.
