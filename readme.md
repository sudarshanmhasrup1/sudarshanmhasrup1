### Know about me

Hi! Thank you so much for checking out my GitHub profile. Let me introduce myself. I'm Sudarshan Mhasrup, and I like to
solve real-world and business problems. There are many ways to do it, but I choose the way of software development. The
reason? Well, I was always curious about how computers work and how I could build my own programs that run on Web,
Mobile, and Desktop. So, I decided to learn programming, which turned out to be the best thing I do every time. I like
to build stuff, not just code.

I started learning to build mobile apps using a no-code tool called `Sketchware`. Later, I learned Java and began
building fun projects using Java and XML. During the second year of my college, I found myself enjoying Kotlin and its
ecosystem. So, I decided to go for it because I fell in love with Kotlin. Nowadays, I'm totally into Kotlin. Its
multiplatform nature has enabled me to develop apps that run on mobile phones, desktop PCs, the web, and more.
